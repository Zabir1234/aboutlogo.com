    <h2>Practice (learning method)</h2>
    <p>
      Practice is the act of rehearsing a behaviour repeatedly, to help learn
      and eventually master a skill. The word derives from the Greek "πρακτική"
      (praktike), feminine of "πρακτικός" (praktikos), "fit for or concerned
      with action, practical",[1] and that from the verb "πράσσω" (prasso), "to
      achieve, bring about, effect, accomplish".[2] In English, practice is the
      noun and practise is the verb, but in American-English it is now common
      for practice to be used both as a noun and a verb (see American and
      British English spelling differences; this article follows the British
      distinction). Sessions scheduled for the purpose of rehearsing and
      performance improvement are called practices. They are engaged in by
      sports teams, bands, individuals, etc., as in, "He went to football
      practice every day after school".How well one improves with practice
      depends on several factors, such as the frequency it is engaged in, and
      the type of feedback that is available for improvement. If feedback is not
      appropriate (either from an instructor or from self-reference to an
      information source), then the practice tends to be ineffective or even
      detrimental to learning. If a student does not practise often enough,
      reinforcement fades, and he or she is likely to forget what was learned.
      Therefore, practice is often scheduled, to ensure enough of it is
      performed to reach one's training objectives. How much practice is
      required depends upon the nature of the activity, and upon each
      individual. Some people improve on a particular activity faster than
      others. Practice in an instructional setting may be effective if repeated
      only 1 time (for some simple verbal information) or 3 times (for
      concepts), or it may be practised many times before evaluation (a dance
      movement).

    <h2>Deliberate practice</h2>
    <p>
      Psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, a professor of Psychology at Florida
      State University, was a pioneer in researching deliberate practice and
      what it means. According to Ericsson: People believe that because expert
      performance is qualitatively different from a normal performance the
      expert performer must be endowed with characteristics qualitatively
      different from those of normal adults. [...] We agree that expert
      performance is qualitatively different from normal performance and even
      that expert performers have characteristics and abilities that are
      qualitatively different from or at least outside the range of those of
      normal adults. However, we deny that these differences are immutable, that
      is, due to innate talent. Only a few exceptions, most notably height, are
      genetically prescribed. Instead, we argue that the differences between
      expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of
      deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.[3] One of
      Ericsson's core findings was that how expert one becomes at a skill has
      more to do with how one practises than with merely performing a skill a
      large number of times. An expert breaks down the skills that are required
      to be expert and focuses on improving those skill chunks during practice
      or day-to-day activities, often paired with immediate coaching feedback.
      Another important feature of deliberate practice lies in continually
      practising a skill at more challenging levels with the intention of
      mastering it.[4] Deliberate practice is also discussed in the books Talent
      is Overrated by Geoff Colvin[5] and The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle,[6]
      among others. This includes, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance,
      by Angela Duckworth[7] and Outliers: The Story of Success, by Malcolm
      Gladwell.[8] Ericsson also believes that some anatomical characteristics
      were believed to be fixed traits in the past. Genes rarely dictate what
      traits will be. However, her study has proven that the characteristics
      have the ability to change and adapt in response to intense practice over
      multiple years. Ericsson's statements on practice also support the 10 year
      rule. Ericsson believes that elite performance is the product of maximal
      effort over at least a decade. The maximal effort is described as using
      deliberate practice in order to improve performance.[3] Duckworth
      describes how deliberate practice affects education, motivation, and
      learning outcomes.[7] In a presentation she gave at the American
      Educational Research Conference in 2014,[9] she spoke about the importance
      of grit – of students' focusing on material with which they struggle. In
      her view, grit allows a student to persevere and succeed in the face of
      adversity. Duckworth says that if a student can apply grit in their
      academic work, their effort will increase. Duckworth says that effort is
      equally important as talent in achieving academic goals. In a study she
      conducted at the National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C, she found that
      the students who used the grit tactic tended to advance to the finals.[9]
      Two recent articles in Current Directions in Psychological Science
      criticise deliberate practice and argue that, while it is necessary for
      reaching high levels of performance, it is not sufficient, with other
      factors such as talent being important as well.[10][11] More recently, a
      meta-analysis found the correlation coefficient between deliberate
      practice and performance was 0.40, the size of which is large compared to
      other predictor variables (eg. obesity, excessive drinking, smoking,
      intelligence, adherence to effective medication).[12] In addition, Malcolm
      Gladwell's point-of-view about deliberate practice is different from
      Ericsson's view. Gladwell, staff writer at The New Yorker magazine and
      author of five books on The New York Times Best Seller list including
      Outliers: The Story of Success said in a May 2016 Freakonomics podcast
      interview that, "He's [Ericsson] a hard practice guy, and I'm a soft
      practice guy." Gladwell claims that talent is important with an
      intentional dedication to practice and having a support system is vital to
      produce superior outcomes. It is not all about methodical effort as
      Ericsson claims. In Malcolm Gladwell's book, one chapter is called "The
      Matthew Effect." This effect describes how different biases can affect an
      individual's performance. When someone is practicing a skill, especially
      with deliberate practice, coaches play an important role in how their
      practices go. If a coach sets high expectations and encourages their
      learners, the individual is more likely to take more from practice and
      perform better. The role of coaches is important during deliberate
      practice. Coaches can strengthen desired behaviors through encouragement,
      positive reinforcement, and technical instruction. Fostering a positive
      learning environment through deliberate practice is key for all
      individuals involved. It is also important for coaches to lay out their
      practices with specific skill training, variable practice, and training
      open and closed skills. These factors lead to an intentional deliberate
      practice which ultimately leads to better learning and performance.
      According to the American Psychological Association, the purpose of
      deliberate practice is to achieve high levels of expert performance.[13]
      Studies also show that due to deliberate practice, an individual will
      experience high achievement. This is due to memory, cognition, practice,
      persistence, and muscle response that all improves through deliberate
      practice.
