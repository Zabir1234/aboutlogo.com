      <h2 class="WH">What is a logo?</h2>
      <p class="d">A logo is a symbol made up of text and images that identifies a business. A good logo shows what a company does and what the brand values.
  
        Logo design is all about creating the perfect visual brand mark for a company. Depending on the type, a logo usually consists of a symbol or brandmark and a logotype, along with a tagline.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">What does a logo do?</h2>
      <p class="d">Logos do something aside from look pretty, right? Yes! Logos serve many functions.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">A logo makes you stand out from the competition</h2>
      <p class="d">Perhaps the most fundamental function of a logo is giving your business a unique mark that differentiates you from other businesses.
  
        Green cactus logo design
        Logo design by am121.
        This is especially important if your business has competition (which 99.9% of them do). Before you get a logo for your business you’ll want to research what your competitors’ look like so you can position yourself.Check out how the Cactus Dental logo separates themselves from the sea of cliche tooth logos in the dental industry by taking a feature unique to their geography and turning it into a toothbrush.
  
        Of course, you don’t want to be so unusual that potential customers don’t understand your brand.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">A logo identifies key information about your business</h2>
      <p class="d">Along with demarcating your business, a good logo also provides your customer with some crucial information about your company: it can communicate the industry you exist in, the service you provide, your target demographic and your brand values.
  
        For example, a company might use circuit imagery into their logo to show that they operate in the software industry. Or they might use a specific color to communicate they are committed to being green/environmental. Or they might use a stylish font to highlight that they are luxurious. Check out how Wild Hearts uses an image of a book with a heart in it to show that their business specializes in romance novels</p>
      <h2 class="WH">A logo builds brand recognition</h2>
      <p class="d">Logos also leave a visual impact that reminds your customers that, well… that you exist!
  
        In other words, logos can create strong visual associations with a business. This association helps customers keep your brand in mind.
        
        Think about brands like Nike or McDonalds, whose logos are so ubiquitous that they can be instantly recognized with or without the name attached. It’s no surprise that logos are such a central part of brand identity.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">What are the elements of a logo?</h2>
      <p class="d">Now that we know what a logo does, let’s look at what they are made of. Star-dust, chocolate chips, recycled board games? Close but not quite!
  
        While there is no definitive answer, we can break down some of the common logo design elements. These elements work together to form 7 types of logos.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">Typography</h2>
      <p class="d">When it comes to form, a logo will usually contain some kind of typographic element. This can range from a monogram-style single letter, to an abbreviation or the full title of the business.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">Imagery</h2>
      <p class="d">Sometimes typography is accompanied by symbols or icons. These can be representative or composed of abstract geometric elements.
  
        In certain instances, logos also include decorative elements such as line work or visual punctuations—such as small stars or dotted lines—that don’t necessarily create a specific, stand alone image.
        
        The Ever South Brewing logo contains typography accompanied by a geometric, illustrated symbol of a sunset with a stalk of grain growing upward.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">Color</h2>
      <p class="d">Beyond form comes color. Logos can be black and white, monochrome or multicolored. Multicolored logos often have palettes that are either analogous, meaning colors of similar hue, or complementary, meaning colors of distant or opposite hue.
  
        The Synergy example contains a full color, complementary color palette. For more on color, check out our Logo colors article.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">Context</h2>
      <p class="d">In some instances, a logo is also defined by the context in which it is used.
  
        House Rules Board Game Bistro Logo
        Logo design by Enola for House Rules Board Game Bistro.
        With that said, it’s important to think about when and where logos can be applied.
        
        Commonly we see logos online, on business cards, in storefronts, advertising and it print. But your business might have specific needs.
        
        In the example on the left, the circular design is a perfect fit for drink coasters!</p>
      <h2 class="WH">Static or dynamic elements</h2>
      <p class="d">One fork in the road in logo design worth mentioning is the decision to create a static logo—one which looks the same everywhere it exists—or a dynamic logo—one which changes depending on its context. Notice how the example interchanges elements depending on the application.
  
        lion logo
        Logo design by RedLogo</p>
      <h2 class="WH">What makes a good logo?</h2>
      <p class="d">The answer: any number of different things. Let’s look at some real-life examples and talk about which elements they employ to successfully communicate their messages.
  
        nooStance logo
        Logo design by artsigma.
        The nooStance logo is composed of simple typography and an illustrated mascot. It uses a multi-colored, complementary blue and yellow color palette. While the overall design is strong, this logo is largely successful in its unforgettable cuteness!
        
        craft beer bar logo design
        Logo design by beko™ for Tapp’d.
        The Tapp’d logo implements an illustrated tap into the negative space between the letters of the business name. This simple but clever concept separates this logo from other businesses, makes it memorable and lets the customer know that this is a place to get fresh beer!
        
        Lieferbrau family brewery logo
        Logo design by Virtuoso” for Lieferbräu brewery.
        The Lieferbräu Brewery is composed of ornate typography and decorative line-work. While the decorative grains hint at the fact that this is a brewery, the message here is class. The design is elegant and sophisticated—there’s no mistake what the brand values are here.
        
        Rhythms app logo design
        Logo design by ks_projekt for Rhythms.
        Some businesses have a name that plays a part in explaining the business and doesn’t need a logo that is overly designed. In the example above, the name “Rhythms” helps let the user know that this is a beat-making app. In this case the designer has filled in the blanks with some colored geometric broken lines. These elements help to communicate the idea that there are tracks and rhythm involved. Ultimately the design does a pretty good job of clueing in the user to what they are downloading.
        
        Skillzy logo design
        Logo design by vallt for Skillzy.
        Skillzy is an online education platform. Their monochromatic logo contains simple text accompanied by a symbol of an upside-down umbrella. The logo is simple and attractive. The meaning of the upside down umbrella is unclear, but it is perhaps the mystery that intrigues the viewer. Is it a spiritual reference to possession? It sure got us thinking! Whatever it means, this simple combination of elements separates the business and leaves an unforgettable mark.
        
        Artisan Pies text logo
        Logo design by Bokisha for Artisan Pies.
        Some of the most successful logos are not conceptual or complex at all. In fact the Artisan Pies logo featured above is perhaps the most perfect possible solution for this business. The name tells the viewer exactly what the service is, the design communicates their no-BS brand values and the serif typeface lets you know that they take pies seriously! Not to mention the name is so simple that it’s hard to forget!
        
        Running hot dog logo design
        Logo design by Michael4682 for Fatima.
        The Fatima Frankfurter 3k/5k Walk-Run uses a running hot dog mascot to tell the story. In some cases obvious is good, especially for a periodic event that wants to pull in as many people as quickly as possible. Don’t be afraid to spell things out for your target demographic.
        
        Sketched farm logo design
        Logo design by IrfanSe for Brollywood Farm.
        The Brollywood Farm logo uses an ornate-yet-simple monochromatic design featuring an illustration of a farm. Not only does it quickly let the viewer know that it is a farm logo, but the vintage look communicates that the brand values are simple and rustic.
        
        Indian Photo Printing company logo
        Logo design by bo_rad.
        The PrinstaIndia uses a complementary monochromatic design that proves that color choice in logo is important! In this case a CMYK palette is used which has strong connotations with printed media. It lets the customer know that if they are looking for printing services that PrinstaIndia can help them.</p>
      <h2 class="WH">How is a logo different from branding?</h2>
      <p class="d">One common confusion we see comes in understanding the difference between logos and branding. It sounds complicated but the difference is quite simple: Your brand is the set of perceptions people have about your company. In other words, it can be thought of as the big-picture impression that your company leaves on the customer. This impression can be left by many things, such as your advertisements, commercials, customer service, and yes your logo as well.

        That’s right, your logo is part of your branding (not the other way around). For example, while the Apple logo is iconic and instantly recognizable, it’s not the only thing that creates their elegant, easy-to-use and customer-friendly brand identity. Those qualities are expressed through their design choices in billboard ads, commercials, web design and on-site store layout. The logo simply holds the visual association to those things. Plus let’s face it, Apple just wouldn’t be the same without that cute, partially eaten Apple.

        <h2 class= "h">Adobe Illustrator</h2>
        <p class="app">First released in 1987, Adobe Illustrator is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, including Photoshop, InDesign, Lightroom, and other programs. It’s a full-featured graphic design software for logos of any size.

            Adobe Illustrator is also used to create social media graphics, advertisements, mobile app icons, typefaces, and artistic illustrations. While Adobe doesn’t reveal exactly how many people use Illustrator, it is a staple of many professional design agencies.</p>
        <h2 class= "h">Inkscape</h2>
        <p class="app">Inkscape is a free graphic design software program first released in 2003. The exact number of Inkscape users is unknown, as users can freely download, share, and modify the software. Graphic designers, artists, and students who may not need or cannot afford an Adobe Illustrator license may like Inkscape.

            The software includes a set of vector design and typography tools used for logo design and more complex illustration projects.</p>
        <h2 class= "h">CorelDRAW</h2>
        <p class="app">First released in 1989, CorelDRAW is a vector design program compatible with Windows and Mac operating systems. B2B analytics firm Enlyft estimates that over 22,000 companies use CorelDRAW and its users are primarily small- to medium-sized businesses.

            Every CorelDRAW package includes vector shape and tracing tools to help users transform ideas and sketches into logos.</p>
        <h2 class= "h">Gravit Designer</h2>

        <h2 class= "h">Factors to consider when choosing the best logo design software</h2>
        <p class="app">Many programs are great for beginner, intermediate, and advanced users—but what’s best for one beginner might not be what’s best for you. Consider each of the following factors when purchasing graphic design software for logos.</p>
        <h2 class= "h">Should you work with a logo designer?</h2>
        <p class="app">DIY logo design is often thought of as a way to save money, but it can cost business owners valuable time. The logo design software on this list only does part of the work. If it is your first time working with vector graphics, you’ll need to learn principles of design and color theory, as well as the ins and outs of your software. Due to this fact, many business owners find that it is more cost-effective to work with a professional logo designer.

            As the world’s work marketplace, Upwork takes the complexity out of the process of finding a logo designer. Start by browsing logo design services on Project Catalog™ and look for designers whose style and rates fit your preferences. With just a few simple clicks, you can get a high-quality, unique logo for your business in a matter of days.

        <h1 class="Illustrator">Adobe Illustrator (Details)</h1>
        <p class="d">Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor and design program developed and marketed by Adobe Inc. Originally designed for the Apple Macintosh, development of Adobe Illustrator began in 1985. Along with Creative Cloud (Adobe's shift to monthly or annual subscription service delivered over the Internet), Illustrator CC was released. The latest version, Illustrator 2022, was released on October 26, 2021, and is the 25th generation in the product line. Adobe Illustrator was reviewed as the best vector graphics editing program in 2018 by PC Magazine.</p>
        <h2 class="Illustrator">Versions 1–1.6 (Illustrator 88)</h2>
        <p class="d">Development of Adobe Illustrator for the Apple Macintosh began in 1985[2] (shipping in January 1987) as a commercialization of Adobe's in-house font development software and PostScript file format. Adobe Illustrator is the companion product of Adobe Photoshop. Photoshop is primarily geared toward digital photo manipulation and photorealistic styles of computer illustration, while Illustrator provides results in the typesetting and logo graphic areas of design. Early magazine advertisements (featured in graphic design trade magazines such as Communication Arts) referred to the product as "the Adobe Illustrator". Illustrator 88, the product name for version 1.7,[3] was released in 1988 and introduced many new tools and features.[4]

        Byte in 1989 listed Illustrator 88 as among the "Distinction" winners of the Byte Awards, stating that with it Adobe had "pulled ahead" of previously industry-dominant competitor Aldus FreeHand.[5]
      
        Early versions of the software did not support working in preview mode and users needed to have two windows open on their desktop in order to have a live preview of their work. One window would show the work in progress and the other window would show a preview of the work in progress.</p>
        <h2 class="Illustrator">Versions 2–6</h2>
        <p class="d">Although during its first decade Adobe developed Illustrator primarily for Macintosh, it sporadically supported other platforms. In the early 1990s, Adobe released versions of Illustrator for Display PostScript licensees NeXT, Digital Equipment Corporation Ultrix, Silicon Graphics IRIX, and Sun Solaris platforms, but they were discontinued due to poor market acceptance. The first version of Illustrator for Windows, version 2.0, was released in early 1989 and flopped. The next Windows version, version 4.0, was widely criticized as being too similar to Illustrator 1.1 instead of the Macintosh 3.0 version, and certainly not the equal of Windows' most popular illustration package CorelDRAW. (Note that there were no versions 2.0 or 4.0 for the Macintosh—although, the second release for the Mac was titled Illustrator 88—the year of its release. And there was no version 6 for Windows.) Version 4 was, however, the first version of Illustrator to support editing in preview mode, which did not appear in a Macintosh version until 5.0 in 1993. Version 6 was the last truly Macintosh version of Illustrator. The interface changed radically with the following version to bring consistency between Mac and Windows computer platforms. The changes remained until CS6 when some small steps were taken to restore the app to a slightly more Mac-like interface.</p>
        <h2 class="Illustrator">Versions 7–10</h2>
        <p class="d">With the introduction of Illustrator 7 in 1997, Adobe made critical changes in the user interface with regard to path editing (and also to converge on the same user interface as Adobe Photoshop), and many users opted not to upgrade. Illustrator also began to support TrueType, effectively ending the "font wars" between PostScript Type 1 and TrueType. Like Photoshop, Illustrator also began supporting plug-ins, greatly and quickly extending its abilities.

      With true user interface parity between Macintosh and Windows versions starting with 7.0, designers could finally standardize on Illustrator. Corel did port CorelDRAW FreeHand still not available in Illustrator (higher scaling percentages, advanced find-and-replace feature, selective round-corner editing, export/print selected objects only, etc.).[6] Famously, Aldus made a matrix comparing its own FreeHand to Illustrator and Draw in which Draw's one "win" was that it came with three different clip art views of the human pancreas.
      
      Adobe bought Aldus in 1994 for Page Maker.[7] As part of the transaction, the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint of Adobe Systems on October 18, 1994, ordering a divestiture of FreeHand to "remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the acquisition"[8] because of Adobe's Illustrator software. As a result, Macromedia acquired Free Hand in 1995 from its original developer, Altsys, and continued its development through 2004.[9]
      
      The difference in strengths between Photoshop and Illustrator became clear with the rise of the Internet, Illustrator was enhanced to support Web publishing, rasterization previewing, PDF, and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics.) Adobe was an early developer of SVG for the web and Illustrator exported SVG files via the SVG File Format plugin.[10] Using the Adobe SVG Viewer (ASV), introduced in 2000, allowed users to view SVG images in most major browsers until it was discontinued in 2009.[11] Native support for SVG was not complete in all major browsers until Internet Explorer 9 in 2011.[12]
      
      Illustrator Version 9 included a tracing feature, similar to that within Adobe's discontinued product Streamline.
      
      Illustrator version 10 was released by Adobe in November 2001.</p>
      <h2 class="Illustrator">Versions CS–CS6</h2>
      <p class="d">Illustrator CS (aka version 11), released by Adobe for Mac and Windows in October 2003, was the first version to include 3-dimensional capabilities allowing users to extrude or revolve shapes to create simple 3D objects.

        Illustrator CS2 (version 12), released by Adobe in April 2005, was available for both the Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows operating systems. It was the last version for the Mac which did not run natively on Intel processors. Among the new features included in Illustrator CS2 were Live Trace, Live Paint, a control palette and custom workspace. Live Trace allows for the conversion of bitmap imagery into vector art and improved upon the previous tracing abilities. Live Paint allows users more flexibility in applying color to objects, specifically those that overlap. In the same year as the CS2 release, Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion and it integrated the companies' operations, networks, and customer-care organizations shortly thereafter.[13] Adobe now owned Freehand along with the entire Macromedia product line and in 2007, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development and updates to the Freehand program. Instead, Adobe would provide tools and support to ease the transition to Illustrator.[14]
        
        Illustrator CS3 included interface updates to the Control Bar, the ability to align individual points, multiple Crop Areas, the Color Guide panel and the Live Color feature among others. CS3 was released on March 27, 2007.
        
        CS4 was released in October 2008. It features a variety of improvements to old tools along with the introduction of a few brand-new tools acquired from FreeHand. The ability to create multiple artboards is one of CS4's main additions from Freehand. The artboards allow you to create multiple versions of a piece of work within a single document. Other tools include the Blob Brush, which allows multiple overlapping vector brush strokes to easily merge or join, and a revamped gradient tool allowing for more in-depth color manipulation as well as transparency in gradients.
        
        CS5 was released in April 2010. Along with a number of enhancements to existing functionality, Illustrator CS5's new features include a Perspective Grid tool taken from FreeHand, a Bristle Brush (for more natural and painterly looking strokes) and a comprehensive update to strokes, referred to by Adobe as "Beautiful Strokes".
        
        Version CS6 was the 16th generation of Adobe Illustrator. Adobe added many more features and several bug fixes such as a new user interface, layer panels, RGB codes, and color ramp to increase performance. CS6 was released on April 23, 2012.</p>
      <h2 class="Illustrator">Version CC</h2>
      <p class="d">Along with Creative Cloud (the result of Adobe's shift on its release strategy), Illustrator CC was released. This version (the 17th) was the first to be only sold in a subscription-based service model, in line with the other software in the formerly called Creative Suite. As part of Creative Cloud, this version brought improvements in that subject such as color, font and program settings syncing, saving documents to the cloud, and integration with Behance (a creative collaborative network), as well as other features such as a new touch-compatible type tool, images in brushes, CSS extraction, and files packaging.[15]</p>
    <h1 class="CorelDRAW">CorelDRAW (Details)</h1>
    <p class="d">CorelDRAW is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by Corel Corporation. It is also the name of the Corel graphics suite, which includes the bitmap-image editor Corel Photo-Paint as well as other graphics-related programs (see below). The latest version is marketed as CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2021 (equivalent to version 23), and was released in March, 2021. CorelDraw is designed to edit two-dimensional images such as logos and posters and it is available for Windows and macOS.</p>
    <h2 class="CorelDRAW">History</h2>
    <p class="d">In 1987, Corel engineers Michel Bouillon and Pat Beirne undertook to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems. That program, CorelDraw, was initially released in 1989.[1] CorelDraw 1.x and 2.x ran under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDraw 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1. The inclusion of TrueType in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDraw into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as Adobe Type Manager; paired with a photo-editing program (Corel Photo-Paint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.</p>
    <h1 class="CorelDRAW">The logo types (7 types of logo)</h1>
    <h2 class= "type">1. Monogram logos (or lettermarks)</h2>
    <p class="d">Monogram logos or lettermarks are logos that consist of letters, usually brand initials. IBM, CNN, HP, HBO… Noticing a pattern, yes? They’re the initialisms of a few famous businesses with rather lengthy names. With 2 or 3 words to remember, they’ve each turned to using their initials for brand-identification purposes. So it makes perfect sense for them to use monograms—sometimes called lettermark logos—to represent their organizations.

      A lettermark is a typography-based logo that’s comprised of a few letters, usually a company’s initials. The lettermark is all about simplicity. By utilizing just a few letters lettermark logos are effective at streamlining any company brand if they have a long name. </p>
      <h2 class="type">2. Wordmarks (or logotypes)</h2>
      <p class="d">Similar to a lettermark, a wordmark or logotype is a font-based logo that focuses on a business’ name alone. Think Visa and Coca-Cola. Wordmark logos work really well when a company has a succinct and distinct name. Google’s logo is a great example of this. The name itself is catchy and memorable so, when combined with strong typography, the logo helps create strong brand recognition.

        visa wordmark logo
        Coca-Cola wordmark logo
        Google wordmark logo
        Also, like with a lettermark logo, typography will be an important decision. Since the focus will be on your name, you’ll want to pick a font—or create a font—that captures the essence of what your business does. For example, fashion labels tend to use clean, elegant fonts that feel high-end, while legal or government agencies almost always stick to traditional, “heavier” text that feels secure.</p>
        <h2 class="type">3. Pictorial marks (or logo symbols)</h2>
      <p class="d">Similar to a lettermark, a wordmark or logotype is a font-based logo that focuses on a business’ name alone. Think Visa and Coca-Cola. Wordmark logos work really well when a company has a succinct and distinct name. Google’s logo is a great example of this. The name itself is catchy and memorable so, when combined with strong typography, the logo helps create strong brand recognition.

          Apple pictorial mark logo
          Twitter pictorial mark logo
          Target pictorial mark logo
          The biggest thing to consider when deciding to go with a pictorial mark is what image to choose. This is something that will stick with your company its entire existence. </p>
        <h2 class="type">4. Abstract logo marks</h2>
        <p class="d">An abstract mark is a specific type of pictorial logo. Instead of being a recognizable image—like an apple or a bird—it’s an abstract geometric form that represents your business. A few famous examples include the BP starburst-y logo, the Pepsi divided circle and the strip-y Adidas flower. Like all logo symbols, abstract marks work really well because they condense your brand into a single image. However, instead of being restricted to a picture of something recognizable, abstract logos allow you to create something truly unique to represent your brand.

          BP abstract logomark
          Pepsi abstract logomark
          Adidas abstract logomark
          The benefit of an abstract mark is that you’re able to convey what your company does symbolically, without relying on the cultural implications of a specific image. Through color and form, you can attribute meaning and cultivate emotion around your brand.</p>
        <h2 class="type">5. Mascots</h2>
        <p class="d">Mascot logos are logos that involve an illustrated character. Often colorful, sometimes cartoonish, and most always fun, the mascot logo is a great way to create your very own brand spokesperson—er, spokes-character(?).

          Kool aid mascot
          KFC mascot logo
          Mr. Peanut mascot logo
          A mascot is simply an illustrated character that represents your company. Think of them as the ambassador for your business. Famous mascots include the Kool-Aid Man, KFC’s Colonel and Planter’s Mr. Peanut. Mascots are great for companies that want to create a wholesome atmosphere by appealing to families and children. Think of all those mascots at sporting events and the great dynamic they create by getting involved with the audience!</p>
        <h2 class="type">6. The combination mark</h2>
        <p class="d">A combination mark is a logo comprised of a combined wordmark or lettermark and a pictorial mark, abstract mark, or mascot. The picture and text can be laid out side-by-side, stacked on top of each other, or integrated together to create an image. Some well-known combination mark logos include Doritos, Burger King and Lacoste.

          Doritos logo
          Burger king logo
          Lacoste logo
          Because a name is associated with the image, a combination mark is a versatile choice, with both the text and icon or mascot working together to reinforce your brand. With a combination mark, people will also begin to associate your name with your pictorial mark or mascot right away! In the future, you may be able to rely exclusively on a logo symbol, and not have to always include your name. Also, because the combination of a symbol and text creates a distinct image together, this type of logo is usually easier to trademark than a pictorial mark alone.</p>
        <h2 class="type">7. The emblem</h2>
        <p class="d">An emblem logo consists of font inside a symbol or an icon; think badges, seals and crests. These logos tend to have a traditional appearance about them that can make a striking impact, thus they are often the go-to choice for many schools, organizations or government agencies. The auto industry is also very fond of emblem logos. While they have a classic style, some companies have effectively modernized the traditional emblem look with logo designs fit for the 21st century (think of Starbucks’ iconic mermaid emblem, or Harley-Davidson’s famous crest).

          Harvard emblem logo
          Starbucks emblem logo
          Harley Davidson emblem logo
          But because of their lean towards higher detail, and the fact that the name and symbol are rigidly entwined, they can be less versatile than the aforementioned types of logos. An intricate emblem design won’t be easy to replicate across all branding. For business cards, a busy emblem may shrink so small before it becomes too difficult to read. Also, if you plan on embroidering this type of logo on hats or shirts, then you’ll really have to create a design that is on the simple side or it just won’t be possible. So as a rule keep your design uncomplicated and you’ll walk away with a strong, bold look that’ll make you look like the consummate professional.</p>
